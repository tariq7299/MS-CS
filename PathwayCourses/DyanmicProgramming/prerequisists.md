For your course on "Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms," focusing on probability theory prerequisites like distributions, expectations, and moments, the key sections from Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen would be:

An Introduction to Discrete Probability (6.1) - This provides a solid foundation in probability basics, essential for understanding distributions and random events in algorithms.

Probability Theory (6.2) - Within this section, you should focus on:

Conditional Probability - Useful for understanding dependencies in algorithms and events.
Independence - Essential for modeling events that don‚Äôt affect each other, a frequent concept in probabilistic methods.
Random Variables - Key for working with distributions and understanding what expectations (expected values) and moments mean.
Bernoulli Trials and the Binomial Distribution - These are core probability distributions that you'll see in algorithm analysis, especially for counting occurrences.
Expected Value and Variance - Essential for understanding average outcomes and variability, which can guide decisions in both dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
Expected Value and Variance (6.4) - Cover this section thoroughly, as expected value (expectation) and variance (a type of moment) are often used to determine average cases and outcome dispersion.

The Birthday Problem and Monte Carlo Algorithms sections could be skimmed, as they‚Äôre more advanced applications of probability. They are helpful but aren‚Äôt core prerequisites unless specified by your course. This selection should cover the "distributions, expectations, and moments" requirements without additional depth beyond what‚Äôs necessary.
